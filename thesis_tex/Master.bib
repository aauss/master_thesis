@article{Jimeno2007,
abstract = {In recent years, the recognition of semantic types from the biomedical scientific literature has been focused on named entities like protein and gene names (PGNs) and gene ontology terms (GO terms). Other semantic types like diseases have not received the same level of attention. Different solutions have been proposed to identify disease named entities in the scientific literature. While matching the terminology with language patterns suffers from low recall (e.g., Whatizit) other solutions make use of morpho-syntactic features to better cover the full scope of terminological variability (e.g., MetaMap). Currently, MetaMap that is provided from the National Library of Medicine (NLM) is the state of the art solution for the annotation of concepts from UMLS (Unified Medical Language System) in the literature. Nonetheless, its performance has not yet been assessed on an annotated corpus. In addition, little effort has been invested so far to generate an annotated dataset that links disease entities in text to disease entries in a database, thesaurus or ontology and that could serve as a gold standard to benchmark text mining solutions. As part of our research work, we have taken a corpus that has been delivered in the past for the identification of associations of genes to diseases based on the UMLS Metathesaurus and we have reprocessed and re-annotated the corpus. We have gathered annotations for disease entities from two curators, analyzed their disagreement (0.51 in the kappa-statistic) and composed a single annotated corpus for public use. Thereafter, three solutions for disease named entity recognition including MetaMap have been applied to the corpus to automatically annotate it with UMLS Metathesaurus concepts. The resulting annotations have been benchmarked to compare their performance. The annotated corpus is publicly available at ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/software/textmining/corpora/diseases and can serve as a benchmark to other systems. In addition, we found that dictionary look-up already provides competitive results indicating that the use of disease terminology is highly standardized throughout the terminologies and the literature. MetaMap generates precise results at the expense of insufficient recall while our statistical method obtains better recall at a lower precision rate. Even better results in terms of precision are achieved by combining at least two of the three methods leading, but this approach again lowers recall. Altogether, our analysis gives a better understanding of the complexity of disease annotations in the literature. MetaMap and the dictionary based approach are available through the Whatizit web service infrastructure (Rebholz-Schuhmann D, Arregui M, Gaudan S, Kirsch H, Jimeno A: Text processing through Web services: Calling Whatizit. Bioinformatics 2008, 24:296-298).},

abstract = {This survey covers fifteen years of research in the Named Entity Recognition and Classification (NERC) field, from 1991 to 2006. We report observations about languages, named entity types, domains and textual genres studied in the literature. From the start, NERC systems have been developed using hand-made rules, but now machine learning techniques are widely used. These techniques are surveyed along with other critical aspects of NERC such as features and evaluation methods. Features are word-level, dictionary-level and corpus-level representations of words in a document. Evaluation techniques, ranging from intuitive exact match to very complex matching techniques with adjustable cost of errors, are an indisputable key to progress.},

abstract = {The current study proposes to compare document retrieval precision performances based on language modeling techniques, particularly stemming and lemmatization. Stemming is a procedure to reduce all words with the same stem to a common form whereas lemmatization removes inflectional endings and returns the base or dictionary form of a word. Comparisons were also made between these two techniques with a baseline ranking algorithm (i.e. with no language processing). A search engine was developed and the algorithms were tested based on a test collection. Both mean average precisions and histograms indicate stemming and lemmatization to outperform the baseline algorithm. As for the language modeling techniques, lemmatization produced better precision compared to stemming, however the differences are insignificant. Overall the findings suggest that language modeling techniques improves document retrieval, with lemmatization technique producing the best result.},

abstract = {In this article, we present a language-independent, unsupervised approach to sentence boundary detection. It is based on the assumption that a large number of ambiguities in the determination of sentence boundaries can be eliminated once abbreviations have been identified. Instead of relying on orthographic clues, the proposed system is able to detect abbreviations with high accuracy using three criteria that only require information about the candidate type itself and are independent of context: Abbreviations can be defined as a very tight collocation consisting of a truncated word and a final period, abbreviations are usually short, and abbreviations sometimes contain internal periods. We also show the potential of collocational evidence for two other important subtasks of sentence boundary disambiguation, namely, the detection of initials and ordinal numbers. The proposed system has been tested extensively on eleven different languages and on different text genres. It achieves good results without any ...},

abstract = {Machine translation (MT) has become a multimillion dollar affair. Fully automatic, high quality translation is not a reasonable goal, not even for scientific texts. This chapter surveys the situations where translation involved has to be of high quality. A human translator, in order to arrive at his/her high quality output, is obliged to make intelligent use of extra linguistic knowledge that sometimes has to be of considerable breadth and depth. Reasonable goals are either fully automatic, low quality translation or partly automatic, or high quality translation. Full automation of the translation process is incompatible with high quality. The two possible directions where a compromise could be struck are sacrificing quality or reducing the self-sufficiency of the machine output. There are many situations where less than high quality machine output is satisfactory. However, when the aim of MT is lowered to that of high quality translation by a machine-post-editor partnership, the decisive problem becomes to determine the region of optimality in the continuum of possible divisions of labor. The exact position of this region will be a function of the state of linguistic analysis where the languages involved are submitted. With machine-time/efficiency becoming cheaper and human time becoming more expensive, continuous efforts will be made to push this region in the direction of reducing the human element. However, there is no good reason to assume that this region can be pushed to the end of the line, certainly not in the near future.},

Our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on six text classification tasks, reducing the error by 18-24{\%} on the majority of datasets. Furthermore, with only 100 labeled examples, it matches the performance of training from scratch on 100x more data. We open-source our pretrained models and code.},
