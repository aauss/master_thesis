\section{EDB Analysis}\label{edb analysis}
Before I could train a classifier to detect relevant article or extract meaningful key words from texts, I needed to evaluate the EDB. It was important to create a labeled dataset for the classification. The entries in the EDB were my positive labels, but I lacked the negative examples, i.e., the articles that were read by the epidemiologists but were not considered.

For this, I extracted all URLs from the EDB and clustered them to identify sources that were used more often than others.
