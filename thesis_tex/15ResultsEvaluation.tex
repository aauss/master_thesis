\section{EDB Analysis}\label{edb analysis}
A substantial part of my work was the exploiting of available sources which includes the EDB and scraped epidemiological news. In the following I introduce how I managed to recover most of the information in the EDB for my further analyzes and how I managed to scrape a large amount epidemiological data with a limited time profile.

\subsection{Source Determination}
Before I could train a classifier to detect relevant articles or extract meaningful key words from texts, I needed to create a labeled dataset from the EDB. The entries in the EDB were the positive labels, but I lacked the negative examples, i.e., the articles that were read by the epidemiologists but were not considered. However, writing a scraper can be time consuming so I needed to narrow down the, at that moment, 75 sources of the EDB.

For this, I extracted all URLs from the EDB and clustered them to identify sources that were used more often than others  (Fig . \ref{fig:netloc}). Then, I focused only on the most used sources that were also unproblematic to scrape (Fig. \ref{table:INIGsources}). I determined the importance of the articles by binning the referenced Netlocs from the EDB and chose the highest ranking ones. The difficulty, on the other hand, I found by exemplary text extractions. With this information at hand I knew which sources to scrape. The EDB contained the work of INIG throughout the year 2018. Thus, I needed to extract all articles of the year 2018 from the determined sources that are partly shown in Tab. \ref{table:INIGsources}.

Furthermore, I assessed the sources for their quality, i.e., whether they only contain information relevant for epidemiological surveillance or also research findings and ongoing projects (mixed content). After exemplary testing, I rated the difficulty to extract analyzable text from these sources where \textsl{easy} posed no difficulty, \textsl{intermediate} would have required additional work but is promising to function and \textsl{hard} was unsure whether it could work satisfactorily.}

\subsection{Data Quality}
Due to the unrestrained column settings, every entry in the EDB was free text with spelling mistakes and different formatting. The transferral of the EDB into a controlled vocabulary was a vital steps since it made more data points usabel. Tab. \ref{table:preprocessing performance} shows that the preprocessing made up to 100 EDB entries accessible per keyword.
