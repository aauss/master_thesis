\acknowledgements{%
In the beginning, I want to thank all the poor souls that needed to proofread my thesis or parts of it, or helped me in some other way finishing this thesis. Thank you, Knut, Rüdiger, Hannah, and in particular Alex, St\'ephane, Patrick, and Jonas.

I thank everyone in the Signale team for making my time in Berlin so enjoyable. Thank you, Max, for welcoming me so openly, yet so eccentric. Thank you Fabse, for giving me a voice when I couldn't and understanding my idiosyncrasies. Thank you St\'ephane and Alex for your excellent supervision. I really appreciated the freedom you gave me but also valued every time you took countermeasures. But mostly I valued that we met each other on eye level. I always felt respected by you and the rest of the RKI people.

My special thanks go to Rüdiger Busche with whom I shared my first student office. I enjoyed each of our conversations, your feedback, and all the other fun things we did in Berlin. You helped me grow and I really hope that our paths will cross again.
